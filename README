This repo consists of 3 code samples:

1) A Java class used to simulate results of a genetics algorithm. (Files: CoalescentSimulator.java)

2) A simple GWT (Google Web Toolkit) app for rating movies. To run it locally, GWT must be set up as dictated at: https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/gettingstarted . (Files: A MovieRating folder, which contains an src folder and war folder. If you don't want to run the app, the files MovieRating.java in the src folder and the MovieRating.css and MovieRating.html in the war folder are the most interesting.)

3) An excerpt from a webpage that uses PHP to make SQL calls. Originally part of a photo album website. (Files: albumDisplay.php)
